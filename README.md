# iOS Term 3 Portfolio 2020
ios-term-3-portfolio-2020-VarunSaini02 created by GitHub Classroom

Hello! My name is Varun Saini, and this is a portfolio of iOS apps that I have been working on halfway through my semester-long iOS class. I began learning about Swift and Xcode through several small projects that taught me the basics. I started off playing around with basic constraints and messing around with stack views and slowly began to look into the progamming aspect of making apps and learned about using buttons and taking user input.

The apps I was able to create in this short amount of time are nowhere near perfect, but in my opinion, they clearly demonstrate my learning. My older apps are quite basic and usually only deal with certain aspects of Xcode. Most of my newer apps, however, combine several skillsets. As time has passed, I've learned a great deal about more advanced topics like using timers and scheduling local user notifications.

As I look to the future, I hope to learn more about databases and using CloudKit. I am also interested about the capabilities of using Bluetooth in iOS apps. 

Ultimately, I hope that my portfolio illustrates my intellectual vitality for the world of programming and accurately displays the skill sets that I have gained throughout my iOS class.

## My Apps

### [Mr. Brightside](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/Brightside) (Scalable)
Mr. Brightside was by far the biggest focus of the first nine weeks of my iOS class. After working on smaller projects and building up my fundamentals, I worked on Mr. Brightside, which is essentially an alarm app, with my friend Blake Branvold. Our goal was to create an alarm app that didn't have to be running in the background to play notifications. Additionally, we wanted our app to play an entire song when the time came, which was difficult because Apple only allows 30 second notification sounds. We overcame this issue by cutting up songs into 29.999 second clips and scheduling notifications at the appropriate times with the appropriate sound clips. Later on, we wanted to make a page to view which alarms were currently scheduled, which turned out to be quite difficult. With each alarm being made up of several different scheduled notifications, it became quite difficult to group notifications together into alarms and display them on a separate screen. This is where we left off, and we hope to keep perfecting this app as time passes. Attached below is an app we made along the way that demonstrates the scheduling of local notifications, which we had to familiarize ourselves with to make Mr. Brightside.

### [Metronome](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/Metronome) (Scalable)
There are tons of metronome apps out there, but very few use images and animations in conjunction with sound. For this app, Blake and I used Timer objects to schedule the playing of a sound and carefully lined up an animation with the sound. Although the app isn't perfect (because Timers don't have a separate thread to run on), it is a good proof of concept for our knowledge of Timers.

### [Rush Hour](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/Rush-Hour) (Scalable)
Rush Hour, based on the popular board game of the same name, is a simple app that is still in its early stages of development. Blake and I are currently working on a way to define Car objects and give them coordinates on the playing board. After we do this, we will likely perfect game generation and work on graphics.

### [Quiz Bowl Scorekeeper](https://github.com/90310844/Quiz-Bowl-Scorekeeper) (Scalable)
Quiz Bowl Scorekeeper is an app made primarily by Pranaav Sriram, another member of my iOS class. However, with his permission, I am including it in my portfolio because I contributed to a great deal of work relating to Buttons, Labels, and other UI objects.

### [War Card Game](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/War) (Scalable)
War is a simple but popular card game. This app, which was one of my first apps ever, was based on a similar design from Chris Ching, also known as @CodeWithChris on social media, and it taught me about stack views, random numbers, buttons, and image views.

### [Multipage](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/Multipage) (Scalable)
Multipage is another one of my first apps that demonstrates knowledge of Navigation Controllers and navigating between pages. Mechanics that I learned through this app were applied to other apps, like [Mr. Brightside](https://github.com/EPCompSci/ios-term-3-portfolio-2020-VarunSaini02/blob/master/README.md#mr-brightside-scalable) and [Quiz Bowl Scorekeeper](https://github.com/EPCompSci/ios-term-3-portfolio-2020-VarunSaini02/blob/master/README.md#quiz-bowl-scorekeeper-scalable).
