Hello! My name is Varun Saini, and this is a portfolio of iOS apps that I have been working on halfway through my semester-long iOS class. I began learning about Swift and Xcode through several small projects that taught me the basics. I started off playing around with basic constraints and messing around with stack views and slowly began to look into the progamming aspect of making apps and learned about using buttons and taking user input.

The apps I was able to create in this short amount of time are nowhere near perfect, but in my opinion, they clearly demonstrate my learning. My older apps are quite basic and usually only deal with certain aspects of Xcode. Most of my newer apps, however, combine several skillsets. As time has passed, I've learned a great deal about more advanced topics like using timers and scheduling local user notifications.

As I look to the future, I hope to learn more about databases and using CloudKit. I am also interested about the capabilities of using Bluetooth in iOS apps. 

Ultimately, I hope that my portfolio illustrates my intellectual vitality for the world of programming and accurately displays the skill sets that I have gained throughout my iOS class.
